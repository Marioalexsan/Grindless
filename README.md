# Grindless

A WIP project dedicated to the modding of the game [Secrets of Grindea](http://www.secretsofgrindea.com).

# Installation

To install Grindless, download the executable and place it in the game's install path (i.e. next to Secrets of Grindea.exe).

# Using mods

To use mods, place them inside the `Mods` folder generated by Grindless inside the game's install path.

# Save files

Grindless uses a separate location for save files, namely `%appdata%\Grindless`.

On first run, you will be prompted to copy over your save files from vanilla. It is advisable to do so, since otherwise you will start out with no saves of any kind.

# Reporting bugs

If (or when) you encounter any bugs or crashes, you can create an issue, or report them to Marioalexsan on the Secrets of Grindea discord.
